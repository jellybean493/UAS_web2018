      <h1>ELIPSS Portal</h1>
      <p>Welcome to <strong>ELIPSS</strong>. This web portal provides visualization and processing tools for data created during the Unmanned Aerial Systems class in spring 2018, held at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/en/">Institute for Geoinformatics</a>          in the University of Münster. The course was held by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/OekologischePlanung/en/team/lehmann.html">Professor Jan Lehmann</a>,
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/IVVgeo/dieivv/mitarbeiter/prinz.html">Professor Torsten Prinz</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/institute/staff/index.php/55/Sergey_Mukhametov">Professor Sergey Mukhametov</a>.</p>

          <p class="homeText">The main objective of the project was the development and application of exploratory approaches using several geoespatial technologies to monitor the renaturation process in the Aa River, located in city of Münster, Germany.<br><br> The
            data displayed is a result of extensive joint work. Our class was divided in multiple project groups: <strong>E</strong>sri Cloud, <strong>L</strong>idar, <strong>I</strong>mage Analysis, <strong>P</strong>roject Management, <strong>S</strong>ensor
            Platforms, <strong>S</strong>enseBox, Web Portal. More information regarding individual group objectives can be found <a href="#/about_us">here</a>.</p>

        <h1>Renaturating the Aa River</h1>
        <p>Greater awareness and actions has been developed in recent decades by trans-national governmental institutions from national to local level, intending to perform renaturation of rivers under the European Union water policies entitled: EU Water
          Framework Directive (WFD) with “good quantitative status” and “good chemical status” of all rivers until 2023. Major challenges that rivers and lakes in European cities face are grouped into: water availability and supply challenges, water quality
          issues, structural changes to and physical modifications of rivers and lakes (EU, 2016).</p>
